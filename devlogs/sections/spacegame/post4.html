<h1>A long awaited update</h1>
Sorry for not posting in a while! Like anyone even noticed lol. I've been busy for a while now, I've been posting my progress on this project on my socials like
<a href="twitter.com/Plokie_">twitter,</a> <a href="https://plokie.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a> and others. So here is a bit of a dump of the progress I've made.

This is prettty much the biggest video that showcases most of what I've been working on. The terrain generation works using the Marching cubes algorithm, and uses a Density noise function
in order to construct the planet's terrain. The atmosphere shader is still kicking, alongside an Ocean shader I made that casts a Sphere using something akin to raymarching.

You may notice that there is no longer an outline shader featured despite there being one in the water showcase, thats because of the grass shader, it was really unappealing,
and honestly looked like shit lol
