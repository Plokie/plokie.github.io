This is a clip of when I first managed to get some cubes rendering on a 3DS. I'm using an emulator in the video, but I've ran it on my hardware and it ran the exact same. <br>
I was so pleased when I saw the triangles behaving and UVs displaying correctly! It's even not rendering faces where blocks connect!
