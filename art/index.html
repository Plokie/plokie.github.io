            Here I'll post my random sketches, simply because I can! I'm by no means good at digital art, far from it, but I'd like to be able to put them all in one place, and show the world! So here ya go.

                <img src="twittergirl.png" class="art">
                <div class="text">This one was just a random drawing I made in like 20 minutes, I thought it'd be a funny idea to make the default twitter profile picture into hot gril!</div>

                <div class="text">I scrapped this one since I wasn't too happy with it, came off a bit too much. However I wanted to draw a way that she would walk aroudn with her computer tower, and decided to see what it'd look like if she carried it on her back. I may revisit in in the future at some point?

                <div class="text">This one is a work in progress, however I had the idea to draw a beach scene because of how hot it was in England at the time, and the warm weather made me want to just swimsuit and dive. I ended up using this for my banner during the summer. <br><br>Plus BOOBA!</div>

                <div class="text">I ended up randomly making this one while I was in an online Maths class. I was messing about with the tools on OneNote for Windows 10, and while bored just sketched a rough sitting thingy. I decided to move it over and draw an actual version, where I decided to try out the style of outlines.</div>

                <div class="text">This is the image that I use primarily as my profile picture on nearly all social media platforms. This was one of the first sketches that evolved into a drawing, of what it is today!</div>
