<div class="description">I ended up randomly making this one while I was in an online Maths class. I was messing about with the tools on OneNote for Windows 10, and while bored just sketched a rough sitting thingy. I decided to move it over and draw an actual version, where I decided to try out the style of outlines.</div>
